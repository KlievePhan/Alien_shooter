## 🔫 Tactical Weapon Arsenal

Choosing the right weapon is the key to survival.  
Each gun offers a **distinct combat style**, forcing you to adapt to the battlefield.

| Weapon | Damage | Fire Rate | Description |
|------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Revolver (Starter)** | 18 – 23 | Medium (0.45s) | Extremely powerful per shot but unstable. Best suited for players confident in precise, decisive shots. |
| **Rifle** | 20 – 22 | Fast (0.25s) | Perfectly balanced. Stable damage output and high fire rate make it ideal for crowd control. |
| **Shotgun** | 15 – 20 ×3 | Slow (0.65s) | Fires 3 pellets simultaneously. Highly unpredictable damage, but a nightmare for enemies at close range. |

## 🔫 Auto Shoot System (New Feature)

To maintain constant pressure and smooth gameplay, **Auto Shoot** is enabled:

- Weapons fire **automatically** when enemies are within range
- No manual clicking required
- Encourages **movement, positioning, and spacing**
- Missing shots is costly — ammo efficiency and aim direction still matter

> **Developer Tip:** Auto shoot helps you focus on survival, but poor positioning will still get you killed.
